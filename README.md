*HELLO THERE!*

SASHA's EPIC WEATHERSITE IS SO EPIC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To use it install npm, run npm build, and npm run dev.
                                                                                                                
I made a weathersite using React, Tailwind, Javascript (funny gif here)
I made a daily weather card, hourly forecast and a search bar.
I used WeatherBit API and I wanted to make a fun fact about this city card using OpenRouter OpenAI API but I did not have enough time.
